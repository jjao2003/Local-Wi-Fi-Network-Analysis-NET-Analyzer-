# Recommendations for Improving Wi-Fi Network Performance

Based on the findings, the following recommendations will improve speed, stability, and coverage.

---

# 1. Change Wi-Fi Channel
- Current channel is congested.
- For 2.4 GHz: use channel **1, 6, or 11** (choose the least crowded).
- For 5 GHz: switch to a cleaner channel (DFS channels recommended).

### Benefit:
Reduces interference and improves throughput.

---

# 2. Improve Router Placement
- Place router in a **central**, **elevated**, and **open** location.
- Avoid corners or behind metal objects.
- Keep away from microwave or Bluetooth-heavy areas.

### Benefit:
Improves coverage and reduces dead zones.

---

# 3. Switch to 5 GHz Band (if not already)
- Use 5 GHz for high-speed devices.
- Keep 2.4 GHz for long-range or low-bandwidth devices.

### Benefit:
Higher speed and lower interference.

---

# 4. Use 20 MHz or 40 MHz channel width appropriately
- 2.4 GHz → use **20 MHz** to avoid overlapping  
- 5 GHz → **40 MHz or 80 MHz** for better performance

### Benefit:
Balanced speed and stability.

---

# 5. Upgrade Router Firmware
- Many performance issues come from outdated firmware.

### Benefit:
Improves security and fixes bugs.

---

# 6. Consider Mesh Wi-Fi or Extenders
- For larger houses or thick walls.

### Benefit:
Eliminates weak-signal areas.

---

# 7. Strengthen Security
- Use **WPA3** if supported.
- Change default router password.
- Disable WPS for security.

### Benefit:
Protects network from unauthorized access.

---

# 8. Enable QoS (Quality of Service)
- Prioritize streaming, video calls, or gaming.

### Benefit:
Smoother performance during heavy usage.

---

# Conclusion
Following these recommendations will significantly improve Wi-Fi coverage, reduce interference, and enhance overall network performance.
