# LocalWi-Fi Network Analysis (NET Analyzer)

## Course
Networking – Exercise 3.2  
Savonia University of Applied Sciences

## Student
**Agozie Joel Onuigbo**

## Objective
This assignment analyzes a local Wi-Fi network using the NET Analyzer mobile application.  
The aim is to understand Wi-Fi performance, detect issues, and propose optimization solutions.

---

# 1. Tools Used
- **NET Analyzer Mobile App** (Android/iOS)
- Mobile phone for scanning and measurements
- GitHub for documentation
- (Optional) Speedtest by Ookla for network speed verification

---

# 2. Measurement Setup
Measurements were taken:
- While connected to the Wi-Fi network under test
- At multiple physical locations within the building
- Using the same mobile device for consistency

Screenshots are stored in the `/screenshots/` folder.
