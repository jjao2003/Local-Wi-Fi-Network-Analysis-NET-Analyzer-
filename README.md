# Local Wi-Fi Network Analysis Using NET Analyzer

## Course
Computer Networks – Exercise 3.2  
Savonia University of Applied Sciences

## Student
**Agozie Joel Onuigbo**

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to analyze a local Wi-Fi network using the NET Analyzer mobile application.  
The analysis focuses on network performance, configuration parameters, signal coverage, interference, and optimization opportunities.

---

## Tools Used
- NET Analyzer Mobile Application (Android)
- Smartphone with Wi-Fi connectivity
- GitHub for documentation and submission

---

## Measurement Setup
- The mobile device was connected to the Wi-Fi network under test.
- Measurements were taken using NET Analyzer.
- Additional tests were performed at different physical locations within the building.
- Screenshots were captured to support all observations.

---

## Repository Contents

- **README.md** – Main documentation
- **analysis.md** – Findings, troubleshooting, and discussion
- **recommendations.md** – Performance improvement proposals
- **/data/** – Collected measurement data and tables
- **/screenshots/** – NET Analyzer screenshots

## Summary
This repository documents a complete Wi-Fi network analysis, covering:
- Network speed and latency
- Signal strength variations
- Channel usage and interference
- Router configuration details
- Practical improvement recommendations

---

## Conclusion
The results show that Wi-Fi performance is highly dependent on signal strength, channel congestion, and router placement.  
With proper optimization, network reliability and performance can be significantly improved.
